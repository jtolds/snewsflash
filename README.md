A news aggregator for people behind on the news

Wouldn't it be cool if you could query some website for news events, sorted by those that have the most impact, over a given timeframe? Sort of like news headlines, but for a week or three instead of a day.

Whenever I snooze and miss a day of headlines, I pine for this tool.
